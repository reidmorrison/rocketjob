    # Dirmon monitors folders for files matching the criteria specified in DirmonEntry
    #
    # * The first time Dirmon runs it gathers the names of files in the monitored
    #   folders.
    # * On completion Dirmon kicks off a new Dirmon job passing it the list
    #   of known files.
    # * On each subsequent Dirmon run it checks the size of each file against the
    #   previous list of known files, and only if the file size has not changed
    #   the corresponding job is started for that file.
    # * If the job implements #upload, that method is called
    #   and then the file is deleted, or moved to the archive_directory if supplied

    # * Otherwise, the file is moved to the supplied archive_directory (defaults to
    #   `_archive` in the same folder as the file itself. The absolute path and
    #   file name of the archived file is passed into the job as either
    #   `upload_file_name` or `full_file_name`.

    # Notes:
    # - Jobs that do not implement #upload _must_ have either `upload_file_name` or `full_file_name` as an attribute.
    #
    # With RocketJob Pro, the file is automatically uploaded into the job itself
    # using the job's #upload method, after which the file is archived or deleted
    # if no archive_directory was specified in the DirmonEntry.
