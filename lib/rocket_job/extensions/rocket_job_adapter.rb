    # == Rocket Job adapter for Active Job
    #
    # Ruby's missing batch system.
    #
    # Read more about Rocket Job {here}[http://rocketjob.io].
    #
    # To use Rocket Job set the queue_adapter config to +:rocket_job+.
    #
    # In application.rb add the following line:
    #   config.active_job.queue_adapter = :rocket_job
    #
    # Example:
    #
    # Create a new file in app/job/my_job.rb:
    #
    #   class MyJob < ActiveJob::Base
    #     def perform(record)
    #       p "Received: #{record}"
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # Run the job inline to verify ActiveJob is working:
    #
    #   MyJob.perform_now('hello world')
    #
    # Enqueue the job for processing:
    #
    #   MyJob.perform_later('hello world')
    #
    # Enqueue the job for processing, 5 minutes from now:
    #
    #   MyJob.set(wait: 5.minutes).perform_later('hello world')
    #
    # Start RocketJob server (or, restart if already running)
    #
    #   bundle exec rocketjob
    #
    # Override the priority of the job:
    #
    #   class MyJob < ActiveJob::Base
    #     queue_with_priority 20
    #
    #     def perform(record)
    #       p "Received: #{record}"
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # Notes:
    # - ActiveJobs will appear in:
    #   - Queued before they are processed.
    #   - Failed if they fail to process.
    #   - Scheduled if they are to be processed in the future.
    #   - Completed jobs will not appear in completed since the Active Job adapter
    #     uses the default Rocket Job `destroy_on_completion` of `false`.
